                            Railway Reservation Program

This Program has been created by "Python Adda(C)" using "Python Programming Language",
As in today's world, everything is online and digital but there are many people who don't know 
how to use devices properly. People have trouble booking tickets online and with secure payment. 
This project is a small initiative to help people book tickets online easier and more interactively. 
It will make booking tickets easier. To make online ticket booking more adaptable and easier to understand 
for people who are not good in operating systems, by the use of images and other more readable things. 
We have used GUI (Graphical User Interface) so it is easier to understand and the Databases can be reset 
by admins at their will. This Program uses tkinter module for GUI and mysql.connector module for Database Connection.
