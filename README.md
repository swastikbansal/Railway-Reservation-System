As a passionate programmer, I created a prototype of a railway reservation system, providing a glimpse into what a well-designed app/program for this industry could look like. By leveraging my skills in software development, I was able to design and implement a functional prototype that showcases my proficiency in programming concepts and techniques. Looking forward to sharing my work with the GitHub community!
