As a passionate programmer, I created a prototype of a railway reservation system, providing a glimpse into what a well-designed app/program for this industry could look like. By leveraging my skills in software development, I was able to design and implement a functional prototype that showcases my proficiency in programming concepts and techniques. Looking forward to sharing my work with the GitHub community!

# Steps for Running
Open Project folder.
Open Project Setup folder and run "setup.py" file.

If there comes an error while running the setup.py file during Modules Installation, you will need to install modules manually.

1. Ensure your PC is connected to Internet and python and mysql are added to System PATH.
2. Open Command Prompt and run these commands one by one,

	pip install mysql-connector-python
